                I have a quite a few computers. Even more or even less depending on your definition of "computer." Right now, a computer is a device that can run/execute code that is either interpreted or compiled, outputs video, has a storage medium connected directly to its motherboard, AND is not a handheld device (like the steam deck).

                    <li>SSD 1: Intel 2 TB (todo: find specific model)</li>
                    <li>Case: Generic Corsair</li>

                I would have went AMD for the GPU but I was able to get a good deal for this 4070. After testing, I figured out that this card was either barely used or something because it ran like new. <i>i hope it wasn't stolen...</i>
                <br>
                I have had this i9-9900K for a while and while it isn't the best CPU on the block, it is still a REALLY GOOD CPU. <s>I only have 16 GB of RAM because I don't really need much else.</s> <i>If a game cannot run under 16 GB of RAM, then the game has really shitty optimization.</i>
                The computer itself runs at around 550 to 600 W by itself, but I put the 1000W in it so it has room to grow before the next power supply upgrade. I have a slow 4 TB hard drive because all it is doing is storing data or playing old games.
                SSD 0 is used for Windows and is completely isolated from my GNU/Linux installation on SSD 1. When Windows 10 becomes EOL, Windows 11 will literally become a small boot partition <i><b>because it is the biggest shit turd that Microsoft has ever produced.</b></i>
                The case is a Generic Corsair because it works.

                &ensp;This computer started its life as an HP Pavillion Power 580-023w pre-built computer designed for the Oculus Rift CV1. I have put some upgrades in it, but to fit the 2070 I literally had to take a dremel to the case. It has such bad thermals that the side panel had to be removed.
                It's a pretty good alternative to the XBOX because it has a GNU/Linux OS on it and Proton support is becoming better and better.

                First, let me describe this machine. The case itself is cheap, and has a surprise ribbon cable that resulted in me breaking the touchpad on it. The case itself is so cheap you could probably break it with a Tootsie Roll.
                Installing a GNU/Linux operating system on it is like trying to cram an elephant inside of a soda can. I had to put Ubuntu Server with nothing but a TTY
                to get it to work. It is currently hosting a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/imreyesjorge/root-startpage">root-startpage.</a> You can preview it <a href="https://root.reyes.cool/">here.</a>

                This is my shitty little laptop. I love this thing. It makes me feel 30 years older than I am. It plays The Ultimate DOOM and DOOM II at good FPS unless theres more than one monster on screen. It is running Windows XP SP3. This site runs on that thinkpad, however it doesn't like JS too much.

                <p style="text-align: center;"><i>This might literally be worse than the thinkpad.</i></p>

                This computer is just spare parts thrown together. I intend to turn this into a NAS. I will put more storage in this thing, with the goal of 20 TB at least. The PSU is unlabeled. There is not much to say about this tower.

                </ul>
                <br> <br>
                This thing was given to me as a laptop that had a problem. After investigation, the original 350 GB HDD had completely died. I replaced it with a spare 500 GB one. I was able to keep it so now I have a macbook running GNU/Linux. Still better than the chromebook.
