      <h1>KOSA is a bill that is being used to violate the First Amendment.</h1>
      Here are some resources that detail just how bad this bill really is:

      <h1>What will happen if this is passed federally or in all states?</h1>
      If this bill is passed, it is a major blow to basic human rights like freedom of speech, privacy and beliefs. <br>
        Sites that have any of these will require users to input government issued ID in to a 3rd party company that have said they will monetize this data:
      <br><br>
      <ul>
        <b>
          <li>Adult entertainment</li>
          <li>Any form of LGBTQ+ material</li>
          <li>Any form of sexual health and reproductive rights information</li>
          <li>Any "depressing" history like of marginalized groups</li>
          <li>Any way to contact lawmakers about changes to free speech laws, firearms laws, etc</li>
          <li>Any way to obtain news that is considered "depressing" by the government. (like the war in Palestine, Ukraine, etc)</li>
        </b>
      </ul> <br>
        When I say "18+ information", I am referring to anything that meets this list EXCEPT for adult entertainment.
      <br>
        It will also hurt any adults who just do not want to give up their government issued identifications. Not only that, it has increased the amount of identity theft as people want to access these services without giving up their identity. <br>
        There have also been reports of surveillance and extortion. Not only that, these companies most likely withold this information meaning if they get hacked bad enough, thousands or potentially millions of people will be at severe risk of identity theft.
      <opinion>There is simply no upside to this bill.</opinion>
      <h1>What will happen to this website if this is passed federally or in all states?</h1>
      If Neocities requires age verification for individual websites or just to access Neocities, this website will only host a link to the onion version of this site. Otherwise, nothing! Bookmark it or write it down if you care that much about me! <br> <br>

        Lost private keys!<br>

      <h1>What should we be doing instead of KOSA?</h1>
      Instead of violating our freedom of speech, we should be providing educational tools that provide parents with the tools that already exist and work better than KOSA ever will.

        If you don't want to use mega for downloading merged files, you can click on scripts, you will get scripts for GNU/Linux operating systems. If you do not use a GNU/Linux operating system, you will have to either use the mega link, write code to do it automatically or merge them manually.

      Ironically, Pornhub has a guide to parental controls on common devices. <a href="https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419885579795-Parental-Controls">You can read it here.</a> (This particular page is not explicit, but the main page is heavily pornographic.) However, the software they recommend is proprietary should not be used.

      <h1>Message to lawmakers in all states:</h1>
      The only word that can be used to describe this bill is awful. Going to a store and showing ID to purchase alcohol is not the same as linking ID to browsing history.<br>
        You can punish one for illegal possesion of alcohol and or illegal possesion of schedule # substances. You can punish one for distributing alcohol to minors,
        and you can punish one for distributing schedule # substances to people who cannot legally possess them.<br>
        You cannot punish one for possesing 18+ information without verifying their age and you cannot punish one for distributing 18+ information to those who have not given up their ID as this is punishing one for speaking, listening and reading within the confines of the first amendment.
        As a consequence, all this bill will do is force minors to commit crimes like identity theft or get someone to make a copy or read information to them in order to obtain information they may need.
      <br><opinion> Nobody wants this bill, and the people who do are either uninformed, have only read the title of the bill or oppose freedom of speech.</opinion>


      <h1>Summary</h1>
      It doesn't matter if you're pro-Israel, pro-Palestine, pro-Ukraine, pro-Russia, pro-gun, anti-gun, democrat, republican, liberal or conservative, free speech is something that is needed by all of these groups. KOSA is a bill that is trying to take that away from all of them.
