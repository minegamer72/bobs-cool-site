      <h1>KOSA is a bill that is being used to violate the First Amendment.</h1>
      Here are some resources that detail just how bad this bill really is:

      <h1 id="whatisit">What is KOSA?</h1>
      KOSA, or the Kids Online Safety Act is a bill that proposes mandatory ID age verification for anything <i>your attorney general</i> deems is inappropriate for kids. What the bill decides is "unsafe" is extremely vague and covers a wide range of topics<sub>(listed below)</sub> which can inadvertently <opinion>(or not, some states governments are assholes)</opinion> harm kids.
      <h1>What will happen if this is passed federally or in all states?</h1>
      If this bill is passed, it is a major blow to basic human rights like freedom of speech, privacy and beliefs. <br>
        Sites that have any of these will likely require users to input government issued ID:
      <br><br>
      <ul>
        <b>
          <li>Adult entertainment</li>
          <li>Sexual health and reproductive rights information</li>
          <li>History of marginalized groups</li>
          <li>Help for mental health</li>
          <li>Help for addiction recovery</li>
        </b>
      </ul> <br>
        When I say "18+ information", I am referring to anything that meets this list EXCEPT for adult entertainment.
      <br>
        It will also force companies that make at least $2.5 billion USD in annual revenue to heavily censor any content that can have even the slightest chance of causing self-harm, suicide, eating disorders, substance abuse, depression, anxiety, and bullying, among other things. While considered a small improvement, most online speech happens on platforms like Meta, X, Snapchat, etc, all of which make at least $2.5 billion USD in annual revenue or more. Smaller companies are not subject to this part of KOSA, however <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/05/us-version-kosa-still-censorship-bill">"they can just use another provision of KOSA."</a>
      <br>
        It will also hurt any adults who do not want to give up their privacy and anonymity online. <opinion>Not only that, it has the potential to increase the amount of identity theft as people want to access these services without giving up their identity.</opinion> <br>
      <opinion>There is simply no upside to this bill.</opinion>
      <h1>What will happen to this website if this is passed federally or in all states?</h1>
      If Neocities requires age verification for individual websites or just to access Neocities, this website will only host a link to the onion version of this site. Otherwise, nothing! Bookmark it or write it down if you care that much about me! <br> <br>

        Lost private keys!<br>
      <br>
      <h1>What should we be doing instead of KOSA?</h1>
      Instead of violating our freedom of speech, we should be providing educational tools that provide parents with the tools that already exist and work better than KOSA ever will.

      <h1>Message to lawmakers in all states:</h1>
      Want to actually prevent kids from seeing pornographic, gambling or otherwise inappropriate content for minors? Invest in programs that teach parents how to use tools that prevent devices from accessing certain webpages. Stop trying to take free speech away from citizens. <opinion>All this bill does is cause problems for literally everyone besides the state/federal government.</opinion>
      <br><opinion> Nobody wants this bill, and the people who do are either uninformed, have only read the title of the bill, oppose freedom of speech or are hackers.</opinion>


      <h1>Summary</h1>
      It doesn't matter if you're pro-Israel, pro-Palestine, pro-Ukraine, pro-Russia, pro-gun, anti-gun, democrat, republican, liberal or conservative, free speech is something that is needed by all of these groups. KOSA is a bill that is trying to take that away from all of them.
