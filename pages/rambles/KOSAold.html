        <h2>What is KOSA?</h2>
        <p>
            KOSA stands for "Kids Online Safety Act" and is proposed as a way to protect children online.<br>
            It's long title is <i>A bill to protect the safety of children on the internet.</i>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Why is KOSA bad for freedom of speech?</h2>
        <p>
            KOSA is intended to destroy freedom of speech online under the guise of "pRoTeCtInG cHiLdReN!!!!!" 
            This bill suggests online platforms to enforce censorship of "information that can be harmful to minors." This is what is in <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3663/text?externalTypeCode=rs&format=xml#id114b8ce2-d765-4e5c-bc33-1a5073a1e5eb">SEC. 3. DUTY OF CARE.</a>: 
        </p> <br>
        <i>
            (b) Prevention of harm to minors.—In acting in the best interests of minors, a covered platform shall take reasonable measures in its design and operation of products and services to prevent and mitigate— <br> <br>
            <ol>
                <li>mental health disorders or associated behaviors, including the promotion or exacerbation of self-harm, suicide, eating disorders, and substance use disorders;</li><br>
                <li>patterns of use that indicate or encourage addiction-like behaviors;</li><br>
                <li>physical violence, online bullying, and harassment of a minor;</li><br>
                <li>sexual exploitation, including enticement, grooming, sex trafficking, and sexual abuse of minors and trafficking of online child sexual abuse material;</li><br>
                <li>promotion and marketing of narcotic drugs (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (<a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:21%20section:802%20edition:prelim)">21 U.S.C. 802</a>)), tobacco products, gambling, or alcohol; and</li><br>
                <li>predatory, unfair, or deceptive marketing practices, or other financial harms.</li><br>
            </ol>
        </i>
        <p>
            The "best interests of minors" is defined by the list above. This gives a covered platform the power to decide what qualifies as one of the above.
            <br>The term “covered platform” means a social media service, social network, video game, messaging application, video streaming service, educational service, or an online platform that connects to the internet and that is used, or is reasonably likely to be used, by a minor. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Why not have a law censoring harmful content?</h2>
        <p>
            Because all it would do is allow censorship of anything.
            <br>
            <i style="font-size: larger;">Remember: Once you give up a right (like freedom of speech in this case), you will <b>NEVER</b> get it back, so fight to keep it!</i>
        </p> <br>
        <h2>How is KOSA bad for anonymity?</h2>
        <p>
            Because it will lead to age verification for all covered platforms. On the surface, age verification seems like an awesome thing because it can prevent minors from accessing pornographic sites and websites that are owned by alcohol, tobacco/vape companies and marijuana dispenseries.
            However, doing so will require a form of identification wether it be an identification card (drivers license, government ID, etc) OR biometric data. (face scan) This is bad for privacy because if you just gave an identification card to someone, now they have a basic profile of who you are and that can be sold. If you gave biometric data to someone, that too can be sold.
            If this is stored digitally, there is also a big risk of data breaches which can leak this information depending on how much access an attacker has.
            <br>
            This could also lead to the age verification requirement for educational services like <a href="https://www.erowid.org/">erowid.org</a>, a popular harm-reduction website because it can be seen as promotion of narcotic drugs. This can be dangerous considering there is always a chance of overdosing or dangerous chemical interactions that can lead to hospitalizations or even death. As has been stated for years, the chance of survival is greatly increased if you are informed.
            <br><br>
            While minors should not have access to narcotics unless prescribed to them, minors will get their hands on them if they are desperate. <i>Where There Is a Will, There's a Way.</i>
        </p> <br>
        <h2>How can KOSA be stopped?</h2>
        <p>
            Contact your local lawmakers! Tell them why this bill should be thrown out!
            <br>
            Here are some other websites that you should check out:<br><br>

        <br>
        <h2>Final Notes</h2>
        <p>
            Be a good parent. Don't give your child a computer, tablet, phone or any device that can access the internet without them understanding internet safety first. Make sure they understand not to talk to any random people on the internet ESPECIALLY if who they are talking to is an adult.
            Make sure they know how to identify common threats like scams and malware. Instruct them not to access pornographic or sites owned by narcotic companies. <i>There are apps and router settings to block these websites.</i>
