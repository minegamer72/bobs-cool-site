    <br>
    <div class="textPage">
        <br>
        The terminal requires a long explanation, so this is going to be a long ramble. If you are looking for how to switch from Windows/MacOS to GNU/Linux, <a href="windowstognulinux.html">read this ramble.</a>
        <h2>The Terminal</h2>
        This is one of the largest reasons that people don't switch to GNU/Linux is because they do not want to spend time or do not have the time to learn the terminal. Eventually, GNU/Linux distributions will get so streamlined that the terminal won't ever be needed. But for now, you should learn the basic terminal commands.
        <br> Open the terminal (you can search Terminal or Konsole for KDE) and type a few of these commands.
        <h3>ls</h3> 
        This lists files in the current folder (or in this case, directory). You should see something similar to this:
        <br> <br>
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [user@debian ~]$ ls <br>
                Desktop     Downloads<br>
                Documents   Videos <br>
                [user@debian ~]$
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        Congratulations! Instead of using the 'ls' command, you can open the file manager Dolphin or Thunar to view and manage files. You may notice the '~' in the prompt. That is called the "working directory" because it is the directory you are working in. '~' is an easy way to say "home directory" which is the equivalent to the windows user folder.
        We can get the path of the current working directory by typing the following command:<br>
        <h3>pwd</h3>
        Note: pwd stands for "print working directory" <br><br>
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [user@debian ~]$ pwd <br>
                /home/user/ <br>
                [user@debian ~]$
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        You may notice that file paths are completely different in GNU/Linux. Instead of having a drive letter followed by back slashes, you instead just have forward slashes just like website urls. As a result, it is a lot easier to type GNU/Linux directories than to type Windows directories.
        <br>C:\Users\user\ vs /home/user<br>
        If you have ever messed around with Windows, you have probably went to the C:\ directory. This is what is known as the "root directory" and in GNU/Linux it is known as '/'. We can go between directories by typing this command:
        <h3>cd</h3>
        Note: cd stands for "change directory" <br><br>
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [user@debian ~]$ cd / <br>
                [user@debian /]$
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        Then, if you type ls, you will see that the root directory is extremely different from Windows.
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left; width: 50%;">
            <code>
                [user@debian ~]$ ls <br>
                bin   dev  home  lib64       mnt  proc  run   srv  tmp  var
                boot  etc  lib   lost+found  opt  root  sbin  sys  usr <br>
                [user@debian /]$
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        If you are following along, you can probably guess that typing "cd ~" will return you to the users home directory. You can also just type "cd" and it will default to the home directory.<br>
        If you want to go to the "Documents" directory, you can either type "cd /home/user/Documents" or if you are in the same directory as the Documents directory, you can just type "cd Documents/". Most terminals will have "tab completion" which will complete words in the given context.<br>
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [user@debian ~]$ cd Docu <kbd>TAB</kbd> <br>
                [user@debian ~]$ cd Documents/
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        This logic can also apply to commands. Anyway, now that you are in the Documents folder, lets learn how to make files.
        <h3>touch</h3>
        The touch command will create empty files with the given name. The name "touch" comes from the ability to literally touch a file, which updates the files modified and access timestamp.
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [user@debian Documents]$ touch important document<br>
                [user@debian Documents]$ ls <br>
                document <br>
                important <br>
                [user@debian Documents]$
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        What happened here? Because the space is a seperator for arguments (basically telling a program what to do), it created two empty files "important" and "document".  
        We can make touch treat this like one argument by surrounding it in quotation marks like this:
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [user@debian Documents]$ touch "important document"<br>
                [user@debian Documents]$ ls <br>
                document <br>
                important<br>
                'important document' <br>
                [user@debian Documents]$
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        The quotation marks indicate a "string". This is just a programming term for a bunch of alphanumeric characters put between quotation marks. You probably don't want the "document" or the "important" files anymore, so we can remove them like this: <br>
        <h3>rm</h3>
        rm stands for remove. It mainly uses the same kind of arguments like before, so we can either do:
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [user@debian Documents]$ rm important<br>
                [user@debian Documents]$ rm document <br>
                [user@debian Documents]$ ls <br>
                [user@debian Documents]$
            </code>
        </div> 
        or
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [user@debian Documents]$ rm important document<br>
                [user@debian Documents]$ ls <br>
                [user@debian Documents]$
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        If you are anything like me, you like to organize your Documents directory. We can do this by creating a new directory.
        <h3>mkdir</h3>
        This stands for make directory. The arguments are almost exactly like touch, meaning we can make the same mistake as before.
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [user@debian Documents]$ mkdir important directory<br>
                [user@debian Documents]$ ls <br>
                directory <br>
                'important document' <br>
                important <br>
                [user@debian Documents]$
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        We can use the command "rmdir" in the same way to remove <b>empty</b> directories. 
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [user@debian Documents]$ rmdir important directory<br>
                [user@debian Documents]$ ls <br>
                'important document' <br>
                [user@debian Documents]$
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        If your directory has files in it, you will need to use the rm command with the -r option. The -r means "recursive" which means that it will go through every file and directory in that directory.
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [user@debian Documents]$ rm -r important directory<br>
                [user@debian Documents]$ ls <br>
                'important document' <br>
                [user@debian Documents]$
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        We can then correct the mistake like before.
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [user@debian Documents]$ mkdir "important directory"<br>
                [user@debian Documents]$ ls <br>
                'important directory' <br>
                'important document' <br>
                [user@debian Documents]$
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        Right now 'important document' is not in the 'important directory'. We can fix this using:
        <h3>mv</h3>
        We can move files using the mv command like this:
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [user@debian Documents]$ mv important document important directory<br>
                mv: cannot stat 'important': No such file or directory <br>
                [user@debian Documents]$
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        What happened here? When using the mv command like in the example, it will first look at the arguments and treat every one of them like a file until it sees a directory. In this case, we never gave it a directory so it would error anyway. Not only that, <br>
        none of the supplied files exist, which is why we got the error we did. We can fix this by doing the same quotation marks method.
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [user@debian Documents]$ mv "important document" "important directory"<br>
                [user@debian Documents]$ ls <br>
                'important directory' <br>
                [user@debian Documents]$
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        As a side note, it usually isn't a good idea to have spaces in your file names and directory names. You should also camelCase them. This way, it is easier to type in a terminal or reference in code. We can view the file like this:<br>
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [user@debian Documents]$ ls "important directory"<br>
                'important document' <br>
                [user@debian Documents]$
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        If you want to correct the file name, we can use the mv command to rename files and directories.
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [user@debian Documents]$ mv "important directory" importantDirectory<br>
                [user@debian Documents]$ ls <br>
                importantDirectory <br>
                [user@debian Documents]$ mv importantDirectory/'important document' importantDocument <br>
                [user@debian Documents]$ ls <br>
                importantDirectory <br>
                importantDocument <br>
                [user@debian Documents]$ 
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        What happened here? The mv command renamed the file, but because we didn't tell it to move to the directory the file was in, it automatically moved to the current working directory. We can move it back into the directory the same way as before:
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [user@debian Documents]$ mv importantDocument importantDirectory<br>
                [user@debian Documents]$ ls <br>
                importantDirectory <br>
                [user@debian Documents]$ ls importantDirectory <br>
                importantDocument <br>
                [user@debian Documents]$
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        For future reference, the correct command would have been: "mv importantDirectory/'important document' importantDirectory/importantDocument" We are going to cd into the importantDirectory and edit the importantDocument. <br>
        There are many text editors for GNU/Linux, but we're going to talk about the two big ones. <br>
        <table class="center">
            <tr>
                <th>VIM</th>
                <th>NANO</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Harder to learn</li>

                        <li>Usually isn't included</li>
                    </ul>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Easier to learn</li>
                        <li>Non-standard controls</li>
                        <li>Usually included</li>
                    </ul>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table> <br>
        I prefer the VIM editor because it allows me to get documents written faster. This page was written in VIM.
        You will probably need to install vim as it does not come with most GNU/Linux distributions. Let's learn package managment real fast:
        <h3>apt</h3>
        This is the package manager for debian. This also appears on Ubuntu based systems like Pop!OS. To install vim, and thus any package, you will need to use the argument "install" like this:
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [user@debian Documents]$ apt install vim<br>
                ... <br>
                E: Unable to acquire the dpkg frontend lock (/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend), are you root? <br>
                [user@debian Documents]$
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        What happened here? This is because we aren't "root". We can use the "su" command to switch to the root user. Think of this as the admin account for Windows.
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [user@debian Documents]$ su root<br>
                Password: (input root password) <br>
                [root@debian Documents]#
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        We can now use the apt command.
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [root@debian Documents]# apt install vim<br>
                Reading package lists... Done <br>
                Building dependency tree... Done <br>
                Reading state information... Done <br>
                ... <br>
                After this operation, # MB of additional disk space will be used. <br>
                Do you want to continue? [Y/n] Y <br>
                ... <br>
                [root@debian Documents]#
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        What if we don't want to switch users every time? We should now edit the /etc/sudoers file to include our user.
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [root@debian Documents]# vim /etc/sudoers<br>
                ## sudoers file.<br>
                ##<br>
                ## This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.<br>
                ## Failure to use 'visudo' may result in syntax or file permission errors<br>
                ## that prevent sudo from running.<br>
                ##<br>
                ## See the sudoers man page for the details on how to write a sudoers file.<br>
                ##<br>
                <br>
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        BEFORE YOU START TRYING TO TYPE!<br>
        VIM is a modal text editor, meaning we need to change modes. Right now, we are in "normal" mode. This is the preferred mode for moving about the editor. We use the keys h (left) j (down) k (up) l (right) for cursor movement. If this seems odd to you, the idea is that your fingers remain on the home row of the keyboard.
        "H is at the <b>left</b>, J swoops <b>down</b>, K points <b>up</b>, L is at the <b>right</b>". I could make up a better phrase, but since this works for me this is all I could bother making. To get into insert/edit mode, we need to either use i or a. A is for after, which starts inserting after the highlighted character. I is the same thing but it starts before.
        Think of it like this:<br>
        i|@|a<br>
        For organizational purposes, we need to go to the section where it says "User privilege specification". We can search and jump to this string using /:<br>
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                ##<br>
                ## User privilege specification<br>
                ##<br>
                root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL<br>
                <br>
                /User privilege specification
                <br>
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        As you can see, root has all sudo privileges. We can copy this line and paste it on the next line using "yank and paste".
        Press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to move the cursor to the search selection. Move the cursor over the line that starts with "root". It doesn't matter where the cursor specifically is just yet. Press <kbd>yy</kbd> on your keyboard while in normal mode. This will copy it to the clipboard. While still in normal mode, move the cursor to the next blank line and press <kbd>p</kbd>. You should now have another "root" privelege. <br>
        Move the cursor over the r in root and press <kbd>x</kbd> until the word root is gone. Press <kbd>i</kbd> and type your username. It should now look something like this: <br>
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                ##<br>
                ## User privilege specification<br>
                ##<br>
                root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL<br>
                user ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL<br>
                <br>
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        Press <kbd>ESC</kbd> to exit insert mode and type <kbd>:wq</kbd> to write/save and quit the file. <br>
        We can now exit the root user by typing "exit". <br>
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [root@debian Documents]# exit <br>
                [user@debian Documents]$ <br>
            </code>
        </div> <br>
        Now, we can run the command "sudo" to run a command once as the root user. You will use your root pasword.
        <div class="codebox center" style="text-align: left;">
            <code>
                [user@debian Documents]$ sudo whoami <br>
                [sudo] password for user: <br>
