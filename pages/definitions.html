            <h2 id="freesoftware">Free Software</h2>
            From <a href="https://gnu.org">gnu.org</a>, <br>
            <i>Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer.”</i> <br> <br>
            When I am referring to free software as in free of charge, I may use terms like <i>"free of charge"</i> or <i>"free as in price."</i> <br>
            <i>Important note: This term is often conflated with the term "open source." While to an uninformed view they may seem very similar, they are actually two entirely different ideas.</i> <br> <br>

            <h2 id="tpmModule">TPM Module</h2>
            A TPM module is a device that restricts the users ability to use their computer by putting DRM on the hardware level. <br><br>

            <h2 id="drm">DRM</h2>
            Officially called "Digital Rights Management", but better described as "Digital Restrictions Management" or "Digital Handcuffs" is a way for malicious software developers like Ubisoft or Microsoft to
            restrict the users ability to use the software that they create. For example, requiring an internet connection to play a game.<br><br>

            <h2 id="floss">FLOSS</h2>
            No, not the Fortnite dance. FLOSS refers to Free Libre and Open Source Software. This is a way to remain neutral between the ideas of Free Software and Open Source software. <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html</a>  <br><br>
