Source code to my new website on neocities.

# What will be put on here
1. JavaScript
2. CSS
3. Significant HTML changes

# What will NOT be put on here
1. WIP or new rambles alone
2. "Posts" in the journal page
3. Buttons in the button collection

You are still free to use the F12 menu for viewing the HTML of rambles or posts or buttons.
