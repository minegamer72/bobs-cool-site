# bobs-cool-site
Source code to my new website on neocities.

# What will be put on here
1. JavaScript
2. CSS
3. Significant HTML changes

# What will NOT be put on here
1. WIP or new rambles alone
2. "Posts" in the journal page
3. Buttons in the button collection

# Why?
I write articles and posts that may violate the TOS of github. If you want to view the HTML for a specific ramble, press F12 and read the HTML source.
