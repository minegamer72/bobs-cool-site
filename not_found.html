    <h1>Hey there, traveler!</h1>
    <p>
        It appears that you have attempted to access a page that does not exist.
        <br>
        <h2>If you are typing in random subdirectories: </h2>
        Feel free to waste as much time as you like! There are no hidden subdirectories. All pages can be found <a href="https://bobs-cool-site.neocities.org/main">here.</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>If you clicked on a link and it brought you here: </h2>
        There are two reasons for this:
        <h3>
            <ol>
                <li>You clicked on a link labeled WIP or 404. I prefer to work in a text editor called <a href="https://www.vim.org/">VIM.</a> I upload the files after I'm done with them or I have enough to fill the links place.</li>
                <br>
                <li>I forgot to upload the file for the page OR I typed the page wrong in the HTML code. If it is unlabeled (this usually means the site is done), <a href="https://bobs-cool-site.neocities.org/pages/whoami#contact">please report it here and I will fix it ASAP.</a></li>
            </ol>
        </h3>
